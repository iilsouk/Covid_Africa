Covid-19 has been less deadly in Africa than elsewhere. This has prompted cautious theories attempting to identify some of the reasons behind the continent’s relatively low 
infection and death rates.  This project aims to draw a comparative analysis between Africa and other continents using Covid-19 statistics, health expenditure data, 
world population data, and Covid-19 vaccination data to investigate Africa’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic.
